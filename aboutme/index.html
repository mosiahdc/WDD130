    <p>Welcome to my page! Let me introduce myself. I have been married for 6 years to my beautiful wife and have a
        5-year-old daughter. I am from the Philippines. I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
        Saints since I was a kid. I love to read and listen to our church leader's talks, to learn and grow myself.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am an online freelancer. I am a student at BYU-Idaho online and currently pursuing a Bachelor of
        Science in Applied Technology to upskill and because of my love for coding. I love reading and watching movies
        in the Documentary and Comedy genres. I'm excited to get to know my classmates. Thank you for visiting my page!
